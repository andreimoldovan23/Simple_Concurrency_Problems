# Simulation of a traffic scenario

- a bridge is undergoing reparation so traffic is restricted to only one direction at a time

- at regular intervals the direction of traffic changes

- the cars wanting to cross the bridge from one side to another must first wait for the direction of traffic to match theirs, but they must also wait for all cars from the opposite side who are still on the bridge to finish crossing

- the bridge has a limited given capacity, only a certain number of cars fitting on the bridge at any given time
