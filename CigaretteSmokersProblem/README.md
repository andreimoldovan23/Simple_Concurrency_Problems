# Cigarette Smokers Problem

- there are three smokers around a table, each of whom has an infinite supply of one of the three ingredients â€” tobacco, paper and matches

- there is also a non-smoking agent who enables the smokers to make their cigarettes by arbitrarily (non-deterministically) selecting two of the supplies to place on the table

- the smoker who has the third supply should remove the two items from the table, using them (along with their own supply) to make a cigarette, which they smoke for a while

- once the smoker has finished his cigarette, the agent places two new random items on the table

- this process continues for a given number of iterations
